Watch YouTube your way!
FilterTube is a Javascript interface that allows you to add live 
enhancements and filters to any YouTube video you like. Viewers 
can adjust brightness, contrast, colors and more. This allows 
people with certain visual impairments to comfortably watch YouTube 
videos while also being a fun webtoy for others. All you need is
a YouTube video code and you're free to adjust the image any way
you like.

  Special thanks to codepen.io users fregante and Dudley Storey
  for their wonderful examples on implementing the YouTube API
  and formatting a full-video background.
